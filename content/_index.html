<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<article>
    <p>Come join us as we practice yoga with a Christian twist! <br> We will move with God through different
        yoga positions. There may be some scripture, prayer and/or a Christian reading incorporated within
        the practice of yoga. This yoga is for all ages so don’t be discouraged from coming. </p>
    <p>Bring a yoga mat if you have one. We will have a few that can be used, but these are limited. <a
            href="https://www.fivebelow.com/search?q=yoga%20mat" target="_blank">Five Below</a> sells them
        at a reasonable
        price. Remember to wear comfortable clothes that you can move freely in with God. </p>
    <p>A donation will be collected for <a href="https://seedsoffaithnh.org/lydias-house-of-hope/"
            target="_blank">Lydia’s
            House of Hope</a> which is a transitional housing program for homeless women and children in
        Somersworth. </p>
    <p>If you have any further questions, please contact: GodInYoga@gmail.com with the subject line of
        “Questions”. </p>
    <p>We hope to see you there. May God shine brightly in you. </p>
