    <p>Hello, my name is Wanda Winnicki. I was asked to teach yoga at women's retreat. I used some of the
        breath prayers and a scripture with yoga poses. I began teaching God in Yoga classes after
        completing yoga teacher training. I am now a Registered Yoga Teacher with the Yoga Alliance.</p>
    <p>I attended Symmetry Yoga Vinyasa Flow 200+ hour teacher training, so I can teach yoga safely.</p>
    <p>Yoga helps people seek flexibility, stability and the self confidence that yoga brings with it. The
        spiritual element of yoga is a powerful part of my life both on and off the yoga mat and I hope that
        I can bring you the joy of both God and yoga.</p>
